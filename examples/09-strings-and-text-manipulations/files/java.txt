Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[12] and specifically 
designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run
anywhere" (WORA),[13] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for 
recompilation.[14] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[15][16][17][18]
particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[citation needed] Java was originally 
developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as
a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer
low-level facilities than either of them.

The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by 
Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun 
relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative 
implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard 
libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
